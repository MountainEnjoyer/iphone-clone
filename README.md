# üì± Iphone Clone

### Hi there !
Welcome to this Repository, it contain the code of a clone of the iPhone 15 pro site with its fancy animations and 3D models. If you're curious, you can visit the live version  [here](https://iphone.zakary.xyz).<br/>

I built it by following [this tutorial](youtube.com). It uses ViteJS, React, TailWindCSS and Gsap.
